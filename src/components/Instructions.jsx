          have found the nth flag
          <b className='px-2'>e.g. flag2_utfutfujygojn</b> represents the second
          flag.

        <li>
          You can submit each flag in the corresponding text box. Please
          remember that{" "}
          <b>you should submit each flag as soon as you find them</b>, and not
          all of them as a whole - this is because we note the{" "}

          found.
